## **Problem Background 📋**

Student lifestyle is an essential aspect that can influence their academic success. Various daily activities, such as:
- Study time  
- Participation in extracurricular activities  
- Sleep patterns  
- Social interactions  
- Exercise habits  

can directly or indirectly impact academic performance, measured by **Grade Point Average (GPA)**. A deeper understanding of these patterns can provide valuable insights into maintaining a balance between academic and non-academic activities while promoting better stress management.
